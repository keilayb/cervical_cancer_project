# cervical_cancer_project

Using a dataset on cervical cancer risk factors, I created a predictive model. All my code can be found in the Cervical-Cancer-Project notebook. The other notebook in this repo contains my attempt at improving my models with the use of RandomOverSampler from the imblearn library. However, this attempt did not improve my models' performance.

The Pipfile has all my virtual environment requirements.

I wrote a Medium post on my findings, which can be found here: https://keila-yazdani.medium.com/predicting-cervical-cancer-from-risk-factors-e47b9a03e887 .
